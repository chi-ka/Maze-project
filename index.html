        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This project was inspired by the classic 3D rendering techniques used in early video games like Wolfenstein 3D.
		 It is a portfolio project for alx fullstack engineering program, showcasing the basics of raycasting and SDL2 for rendering 3D environments.</p>
		 The project is ment to higligth all the skills gained in this course so far.
		 <p>The Game is set around a player who tries to get his way out of a maze built with  texture brick, all the while avoiding obstacles that have been set in its path. </p>
		 <p>Here, you can create an account so that you can save your progress and access it from any device. Update your profile information so that you can personalize my gaming experience.
			and save your game progress so that you can continue from where I left off at a later time.
